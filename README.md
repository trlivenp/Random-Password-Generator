# Random_Password_Generator

## Description

For this project, I set out on a goal to provide a way for someone to recieve a randomly generated password with whatever character types they would like in it. This project allows a user to simply click a button and after doing so, 5 prompts appear one after the other on the screen to decide the parameters of what will be contained in the password. The user will be able to have a password length between 8-128 characters and depending on what they choose, the password may contain uppercase, lowercase, and/or special characters as well as numbers. While completing this project I learned how to properly utilize for loops and an eventlistener.

If an invalid number is entered the prompt will inform you that number is not within the parameters and to try again.

Once the length has been inputted. There will be a total of 4 more prompts appearing. Each one will be asking if you will like to have a specific character type included in the generated password. First prompt will be asking if you want lowercase letters in the password.
